I am a postdoc researcher in the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at the University of Florida, working with [Ben Baiser](http://www.wec.ufl.edu/faculty/baiser).

I am broadly interested in community ecology, global change ecology, and the causes and consequences of biodiversity. To answer ecological questions, I develop and apply quantitative tools to empirical datasets. I am passionate in open and reproducible science, scientific communication, and teaching quantitative skills.

My thesis study is about long-term dynamics of taxonomic, functional trait and phylogenetic dynamics of central sand plain pine barrens communities in Wisconsin (1958-2012). You can find my exit seminar [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53PN-ckOYyk).

I like watching movies and sports games, listening musics, hiking, photographing, etc.

I like it when people say hi! You can find my contact information at the very bottom of this page.
