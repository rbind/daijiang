## The problem

On the Linux server, I have recently upgraded R version to 4.3.1. Today, when I try to use the `arrow` R package to read some large data files, I got the following error:  

```bash
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘arrow’ in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
 unable to load shared object '/home/dli/R/arrow/libs/arrow.so':
  libcrypto.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

It seems that the file `libcrypto.so.1.1` is missing (not sure why as I did not change the OS in the past couple of months).

## Solution

It seems that `libcrypto.so.1.1` is included in the `libssl1.1` program. I browsed the options at http://nz2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/?C=M;O=D 

```bash
wget http://nz2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb
```

Use the above command to install the missing program. Problem solved. Sign... :smiling_face_with_tear: :smiling_face_with_tear:
