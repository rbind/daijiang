## [Advances in Digital Media Workshop Series: Yale](https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/Advances_in_Digital_Media_Workshop_Series:_Yale)

Here are just some of my very brief notes (pretty much just keywords).

- LightningBug: 
  - digitizing specimen labels using ML
  - Meta's Segmentation tool Segment Anything Model (SAM) is good and faster than r-cnn
  - 200k images, 6.9k specimens
- Heritage Science
  - NSF Mid-scale research program
- [MorphoSource](https://www.morphosource.org/): 3D, 2D, AV media data repository
  - Maybe a good place to look for exemplary sites for PhenoBase
- Audiovisual Core
- Expanding LeafMachine2: new training data, models, and methods for processing herbarium specimens; Will Weaver, PhD Candidate, University of Michigan
- Detectron by facebook to detect objects from images
- Imageomics ?  
- Phylogeny-guided neural network (phylo-NNs) Elhamod et al, KDD 2023
- [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) 
- Phenotypic diversity
  - Phenological diversity
  - Phenome space
  - Segament Anything Model (SAM) + Grounding DINO
  - t-SNE visualization for clustering data
- More training data is not always better for ML models
  - If additional related but not present images are added
- Multimodel AI models
  - CLIP
  - LMMs as effective rerankers
  - INQUIRE: text-to-image search of iNaturalist images
- 2D to 3D reconstruction
  - Surface-to-volume ratio seems to be well preserved in shark, snakes
