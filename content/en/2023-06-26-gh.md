title: Git used wrong path of `gh`

## The problem

On the Linux server, I have installed `homebrew` to manage software and installed `gh` to manage GitHub authorizations. It used to work well. Today, I am trying to use `git push` to push commits to GitHub there after a while without using it. However, it complained that it cannot find the `gh` bin. 

```bash
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/gh/2.14.3/bin/gh auth git-credential get: 1: /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/gh/2.14.3/bin/gh: not found
```

It seems that this is the version issue for `gh` as brew has updated it to a later version. Yet, somehow the `git push` is still using the old path.

## Solution

```bash
gh auth setup-git
```

Use the above command to set or update `git` to use GitHub CLI `gh` as the credential helper for all authenticated hosts. Problem solved.
